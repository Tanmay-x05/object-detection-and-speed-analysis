This project provides a robust computer vision–based solution for highway traffic analysis. It integrates the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 object detection model with a custom Euclidean distance–based tracking algorithm to accurately detect, track, and estimate the speed of vehicles from surveillance video footage.
The system processes video frames in real time, identifies multiple vehicles, maintains consistent object identities across frames, and computes vehicle speed using pixel displacement over time. By combining deep learning–based detection with classical tracking and motion analysis techniques, the project delivers reliable performance for traffic monitoring and intelligent transportation applications.
Designed with a modular and extensible architecture, the project allows easy experimentation with detection models, tracking logic, and speed calculation methods. It serves as a practical implementation of computer vision concepts applied to real-world traffic scenarios and is suitable for academic research, smart city solutions, and highway surveillance systems.
